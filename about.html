        <div class="pageContent">
            <p class="description">Thanks for checking out our game! We are a group of Software Engineering majors at Stevens Institude of Technology. Currently,
                we are enrolled in the course SSW215: Individual Software Engineering, and this is our Semester Project! Our goal was to 
                create something for the community, and because it was the 150th Anniversry of Stevens Institude of Technology, we decided to
                base our project off of our amazing university! We worked hard to make this project the best it can be (with the skillset we
                currently have), and we hope you enjoy our game!
                <br><br>Thank you!</p>
